REST API -JSON
What is rest APi ? 
A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services. It allows different systems to communicate over HTTP, enabling the exchange of data in a standardized format, typically JSON or XML.

Key principles of REST APIs:

Stateless: Each request from a client to the server must contain all the necessary information; the server does not retain client state between requests.
Resource-based: Data and functionalities are accessed using unique URIs representing resources (e.g., /users, /products).
#HTTP Methods:
GET: Retrieve data.
POST: Create new data.
PUT: Update existing data.
DELETE: Remove data.
